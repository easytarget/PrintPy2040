## Test tools:
* `telnetSunflower.py`
 * See comment in RRFconfig.py.example for connection details
 * Run on my desktop machine to log and collect M409 responses from the machine without needing a physical Serial connection..
 * Generates TEST data for the actual PrintPy code development.
 * Will be used to prototype the logic for the main code; doing this on the desktop is very convenient..
 * `telnet` is convenient to use remotely since it closely resembles the serial port.
