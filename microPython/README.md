# Microipython code is a WIP!
Development of the communications code happens in the `serialOM` repo:
https://github.com/easytarget/serialOM
* This has a seperate 'microPython' tree with a compatible serialOM variant.

## Releases will be placed here
The 'Firmware' folder contains the reference firmware, *not* a precompiled image. mmmkay.

## Currently:
This folder contains a 'bare minimum' sketch to test screens and buttons.
