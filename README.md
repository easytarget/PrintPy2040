### Same Idea; different MCU

# Proudly Presenting the PrintPy.

**A Work In Progress!**

* the case is done and printed
* the XIAO RP2040 board is in place
* wiring is complete
* Code is in progress
  * Alpha-2 is working well
  * Needs chamber + multi-extruder support, message marquee, info screens, wifi toggle
![Alpha demo](Docs/alpha2.close.jpg)

See the [README](microPython/README.md) in the '[microPython](microPython/)' folder for more.

# Hardware
This is designed to be a relatively simple build; needing soldering skills and care, but little more.
[![Case Render](Case/exploded-thumb.png)](Case/exploded.png)

## Parts:
1. A SeeedStudio XIAO RP 2040 devboard
2. Two SSD1306 OLED I2C displays; the yellow/blue displays I use in my project work well, but any color display of the same size will work.
3. Hookup wire; thin.
4. (optional) A press Button; the design used here is quite common, the case has enough space to accomodate other types
5. (optional) A 5-pin du-pont socket strip, I had to cut down and trim a longer strip.
  * Alternatively you can have a direct wire from the PrintPY to the board, depending on needs.

You will also need a UART cable suitable for your board, the cable below is for a Duet2.
* The Duet3+ ranges use a different JST plug on the board. This has 3.3v available avoiding the need to bring 5V to the PrintPY

## Case
The case needs care when slicing and printing, some of the clearances are very tight. use a slicer with adaptive layer height features to make sure the screens and PCB's fit correctly.

## Wiring 5V (Duet 2)
![Hookup Guide](Docs/printpy_bb.svg)

There is no PCB needed for this, the circuit should be wired + soldered directly in-place (this is fiddly, but possible)

## Connection 5V (Duet 2)
Take care with wiring this, it is important that the 5V supply does not contact the (3v3) TX/RX lines! The connector allows the plug to be reversed to swap TX/RX lines quickly and safely.

## Alternate connections/deployments
### RP2040 I2C pins
If using an alternate RP2040 board please check the table below to determine which pins the I2C interfaces can be accessed on; and make sure the pins are correctly defined in the code.
```
I2C0 – SDA : GP0 / GP4 / GP8  / GP12 / GP16 / GP20
I2C0 – SCL : GP1 / GP5 / GP9  / GP13 / GP17 / GP21
I2C1 – SDA : GP2 / GP6 / GP10 / GP14 / GP18 / GP26
I2C1 – SCL : GP3 / GP7 / GP11 / GP15 / GP19 / GP27
```
